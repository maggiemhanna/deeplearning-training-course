    "When building machine learning models, you need to choose various [hyperparameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)), such as the dropout rate in a layer or the learning rate. These decisions impact model metrics, such as accuracy. Therefore, an important step in the machine learning workflow is to identify the best hyperparameters for your problem, which often involves experimentation. This process is known as \"Hyperparameter Optimization\" or \"Hyperparameter Tuning\".\n",
