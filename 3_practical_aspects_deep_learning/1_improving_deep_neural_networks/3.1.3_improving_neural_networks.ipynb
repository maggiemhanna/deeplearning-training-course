    "\n",
    "Among the best practices for training a Neural Network is to normalize your data to obtain a mean close to 0. Normalizing the data generally speeds up learning and leads to faster convergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you normalize your inputs this will speed up the training process a lot.\n",
    "    * Normalization are going on these steps:\n",
    "    * Let `x(i)` be the input vector for observation `(i)`, i.e. $x^{(i)}_1, x^{(i)}_2, ..., x^{(i)}_N$\n",
    "    * Get the mean of the training set: `mean = (1/m) * sum(x(i))`\n",
    "    * Subtract the mean from each input: `X = X - mean`\n",
    "    * This makes your inputs centered around 0.\n",
    "    * Get the variance of the training set: `variance = (1/m) * sum(x(i)^2)`\n",
    "    * Normalize the variance. `X /= variance`\n",
    "* These steps should be applied to training, validation, and testing sets (but using mean and variance of the train set).\n",
    "* Why normalize?\n",
    "    * If we don't normalize the inputs our cost function will be deep and its shape will be inconsistent (elongated) then optimizing it will take a long time.\n",
    "    * But if we normalize it the opposite will occur. The shape of the cost function will be consistent (look more symmetric like circle in 2D example) and we can use a larger learning rate alpha - the optimization will be faster.\n",

    "## 2.1. Normalizing activations in a network\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rise of deep learning, one of the most important ideas has been an algorithm called **batch normalization**, created by two researchers, Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy. Batch Normalization speeds up learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we normalized inputs by subtracting the mean and dividing by variance. This helped a lot for the shape of the cost function and for reaching the minimum point faster. The question is: for any hidden layer can we normalize the activations to train the weights and the biases faster? This is what batch normalization is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some debates in the deep learning literature about whether we should normalize values before the activation function Z[l] or after applying the activation function A[l]. In practice, normalizing Z[l] is done more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Batch normalization does some regularization:\n",
    "    * Each mini batch is scaled by the mean/variance computed of that mini-batch.\n",
    "    * This adds some noise to the values `Z[l]` within that mini batch. So similar to dropout it adds some noise to each hidden layer's activations.\n",
    "    * This has a slight regularization effect.\n",
    "    * Using bigger size of the mini-batch you are reducing noise and therefore regularization effect.\n",
    "    * Don't rely on batch normalization as a regularization. It's intended for normalization of hidden units, activations and therefore speeding up learning. For regularization use other regularization techniques (L2 or dropout).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.4. Batch normalization at test time\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we train a NN with Batch normalization, we compute the mean and the variance of the mini-batch.\n",
    "* In testing we might need to process examples one at a time. The mean and the variance of one example won't make sense.\n",
    "* We have to compute an estimated value of mean and variance to use it in testing time.\n",
    "* We can use the weighted average across the mini-batches.\n",
    "* We will use the estimated values of the mean and variance to test.\n",
    "* This method is also sometimes called \"Running average\".\n",
    "* In practice most often you will use a deep learning framework and it will contain some default implementation of doing such a thing."

    "When training a deep neural network with gradient based learning and backpropagation, we find the partial derivatives by traversing the network from the the final layer (y_hat) to the initial layer. Using the chain rule, layers that are deeper into the network go through continuous matrix multiplications in order to compute their derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a network of n hidden layers, n derivatives will be multiplied together. If the derivatives are large then the gradient will increase exponentially as we propagate down the model until they eventually explode, and this is what we call the problem of exploding gradient. Alternatively, if the derivatives are small then the gradient will decrease exponentially as we propagate through the model until it eventually vanishes, and this is the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

With such a deep neural network, if your activations or gradients increase or decrease exponentially as a function of L, then these values could get really big or really small. And this makes training difficult, especially if your gradients are exponentially smaller than L, then gradient descent will take tiny little steps. It will take a long time for gradient descent to learn anything.\n",

If the weights have been initialized to the same values (for example zeros), this will make all consequent neurons to have exactly the same value, leading to the problem of symmetry. It is however okay to initialize the biases $b^{[l]}$ to zeros. Symmetry is still broken so long as $W^{[l]}$ is initialized randomly. One thing to pay attention to though is that different initializations lead to different results.\n",
