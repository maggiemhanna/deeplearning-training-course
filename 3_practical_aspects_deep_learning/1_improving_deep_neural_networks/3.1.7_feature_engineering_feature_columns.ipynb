    "# Feature Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial details feature columns. Think of feature columns as the intermediaries between raw data and Estimators. Feature columns are very rich, enabling you to transform a diverse range of raw data into formats that Estimators can use, allowing easy experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In simple words feature column are bridge between raw data and estimator or model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/images/feature_columns/feature_cloud.jpg\" alt=\"feature_cloud\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some real-world features (such as, longitude) are numerical, but many are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input to a Deep Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of data can a deep neural network operate on? The answer is, of course, numbers (for example, tf.float32). After all, every neuron in a neural network performs multiplication and addition operations on weights and input data. Real-life input data, however, often contains non-numerical (categorical) data. For example, consider a product_class feature that can contain the following three non-numerical values:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  kitchenware\n",
    "* electronics\n",
    "* sports\n",
    "\n",
    "ML models generally represent categorical values as simple vectors in which a 1 represents the presence of a value and a 0 represents the absence of a value. For example, when product_class is set to sports, an ML model would usually represent product_class as [0, 0, 1], meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    " * 0: kitchenware is absent\n",
    " *  0: electronics is absent\n",
    " *  1: sports is present\n",
    "\n",
    "So, although raw data can be numerical or categorical, an ML model represents all features as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "As the following figure suggests, you specify the input to a model through the feature_columns argument of an Estimator (DNNClassifier for Iris). Feature Columns bridge input data (as returned by input_fn) with your model.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Feature columns bridge raw data with the data your model needs. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   To create feature columns, call functions from the tf.feature_column module. This tutorial explains nine of the functions in that module. As the following figure shows, all nine functions return either a Categorical-Column or a Dense-Column object, except bucketized_column, which inherits from both classes:\n",

Notice the one-hot values below describe which age range each row matches.\n",

    "Why would you want to split a number—a perfectly valid input to your model—into a categorical value? Well, notice that the categorization splits a single input number into a four-element vector. Therefore, the model now can learn four individual weights rather than just one; four weights creates a richer model than one weight. More importantly, bucketizing enables the model to clearly distinguish between different year categories since only one of the elements is set (1) and the other three elements are cleared (0). For example, when we just use a single number (a year) as input, a linear model can only learn a linear relationship. So, bucketing provides the model with additional flexibility that the model can use to learn.\n",

For a number of reasons, as the number of categories grow large, it becomes infeasible to train a neural network using one-hot encodings. We can use an embedding column to overcome this limitation. Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an [embedding column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) represents that data as a lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1.
