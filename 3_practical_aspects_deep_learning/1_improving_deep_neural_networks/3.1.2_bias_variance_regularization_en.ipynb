    "\n",
    "Let's look at the following simple example. If you fit a straight line to the data, maybe a simple linear regression, then this is not a very good fit to the data. This is problem of a high bias, we also say that our model is underfitting the data. On the opposite end, if you fit an incredibly complex regressor, maybe a deep neural network, or a neural network with many hidden units, it's possible that you fit the data perfectly, but that doesn't look like a great fit either. So this is called a regressor of high variance and we also say that this model is overfitting the data. A model in between, with a medium level of complexity, fits the data correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, in machine learning we usually split our data into two subsets: training data and testing data (and sometimes to three: train, validate and test), and fit our model on the train data, in order to make predictions on the test data. When we do that, one of two thing might happen: we overfit our model or we underfit our model. \n",

    "**Overfitting** means that model we trained has trained “too well” and is now, well, fit too closely to the training dataset. This is also called a **high variance** problem. This usually happens when the model is too complex (i.e. too many features/variables compared to the number of observations). This model will be very accurate on the training data but will probably be very not accurate on untrained or new data. It is because this model is not generalized and can’t make any inferences on new unseen data, which is, ultimately, what you are trying to do. Basically, when this happens, the model learns the “noise” in the training data instead of the actual relationships between variables in the data.\n",

    "In contrast to overfitting, when a model is underfitted, it means that the model does not fit the training data and therefore misses the trends in the data. It also means the model cannot be generalized to new data. As you probably guessed (or figured out!), this is usually the result of a very simple model (not enough predictors/independent variables). It could also happen when, for example, we fit a linear model (like linear regression) to data that is not linear.

    "Let us try to visualize the effect of $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization by plotting them. For making visualization easy, let us plot them in 2D space. For that we suppose that we just have two parameters $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization forces the model optimisation to find the best trade-off between the initial cost function and the complexity of the model represented by the penalty/regularization term $P(\\lambda,\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we keep the regularization term $P(\\lambda,\\theta)$ smaller than certain value, we've achieved our goal. Now let's visualize what it means for the $L_2$ norm of our weight vector to be under certain value, let's say 1. Since $L_2$ is the Euclidean distance from the origin, our desired vector should then be bound within a circle with a radius of 1, centered on the origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was great at keeping weights small, but it can leave the model unnecessarily large and complex, since all of the features may still remain even with small weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to keep $L_1$ norm under certain value, the area in which our weight vector can reside will take the shape of the diamond shown below. The most important takeaway here is that, when applying $L_1$ regularization, the optimal value of certain weights can end up being zero, and that's because of the extreme diamond shape of this optimal region. Thus as opposed to the smooth circular shape in $L_2$ regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property of $L_1$ regularization is extensively used as a feature selection mechanism. This acts as a built-in feature selector by killing all bad features and leaving only the strongest in the model. This has many benefits especially with sparse features. With fewer coefficients to store and load, there is a reduction in storage and memory needed with a much smaller model size, which is especially important for embedded models. \n",

The $L_0$ for $p=0$ norm is the count of the non-zero values in a vector, and the L-infinity norm for $p \\to \\infty$ the maximum absolute value of any value in a vector.\n",

    "### 2.1.4. Elastic Net regularization\n",
    " \n",
    "In practice, usually the $L_2$-norm provides more generalizable models than the $L_1$-norm. However, in some situations, we will end up with much more complex heavy models if we use $L_2$ instead of $L_1$. This happens because often features have high correlation with each other, and the $L_1$ regularization uses one of them and throw away the other, whereas $L_2$\n",
    "regularization will keep both features and keep their weight magnitudes small. Therefore, with $L_1$, you can end up with a smaller model but it may be less predictive. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the best of both worlds, a third commonly used model of regression is the Elastic Net which incorporates penalties from both $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization. This way, you get the benefits of sparsity for really poor predictive features while also keeping decent and great features with smaller weights to provide a good generalization. The only trade off now is that there are two instead of one hyperparameters to tune with the two different $\\lambda$ regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(\\theta)\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m (h(x_i)-y_i)^2 +\\ \\lambda_1\\sum_{j=1}^n|\\theta_j|+\\ \\lambda_2\\sum_{j=1}^n\\theta_j^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to write the cost function in Elastic Net includes having a regularization parameter $\\lambda$ and another parameter $\\alpha$ corresponding to the weight of $L_1$ and $L_2$ penalty in your cost function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(\\theta)\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m (h(x_i)-y_i)^2 +\\ \\lambda( \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^n\\theta_j^2 + \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^n|\\theta_j| ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in addition to setting and choosing a $\\lambda$ value, elastic net also allows us to tune the $\\alpha$ parameter where $\\alpha = 0$ corresponds to ridge and $\\alpha = 1$ to lasso. Simply put, if you plug in $0$ for $\\alpha$, the penalty function reduces to the $L_1$ (ridge) term and if we set $\\alpha$ to $1$ we get the $L_2$ (lasso) term. Therefore we can choose an alpha value between 0 and 1 to optimize the elastic net. Effectively this will shrink some coefficients and set some to 0 for sparse selection.\n",

    "### 2.1.5. Dropout Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dropout” in machine learning refers to the process of randomly ignoring certain nodes in a layer during training.\n",
    "In the figure below, the neural network on the left represents a typical neural network where all units are activated. On the right, the red units have been dropped out of the model — the values of their weights and biases are not considered during training.\n",

    "<img src=\"figures/dropout.png\" alt=\"dropout\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply dropout to a neural network, we’re creating a “thinned” network with unique combinations of the units in the hidden layers being dropped randomly at different points in time during training. Each time the gradient of our model is updated, we generate a new thinned neural network with different units dropped based on a probability hyperparameter p. Training a network using dropout can thus be viewed as training loads of different thinned neural networks and merging them into one network that picks up the key properties of each thinned network.\n",
    "This process allows dropout to reduce the overfitting of models on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/dropout_classification_error.jpeg\" alt=\"dropout_classification_error\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph, taken from the paper “Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting” by Srivastava et al., compares the change in classification error of models without dropout to the same models with dropout (keeping all other hyperparameters constant). All the models have been trained on the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "It is observed that the models with dropout had a lower classification error than the same models without dropout at any given point in time. A similar trend was observed when the models were used to train other datasets in vision, as well as speech recognition and text analysis.\n",
    "The lower error is because dropout helps prevent overfitting on the training data by reducing the reliance of each unit in the hidden layer on other units in the hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverted Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways of implementing dropout. The most common technique is called **inverted dropout**. For the sake of completeness, let's say we want to illustrate this with a neural network of 3 layers. So, in the following code we'll be illustrating how to represent dropout in a single layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "keep_prob = 0.8   # 0 <= keep_prob <= 1\n",
    "l = 3  # this code is only for layer 3\n",
    "# the generated number that are less than 0.8 will be dropped. 80% stay, 20% dropped\n",

    "a3 = a3 / keep_prob       \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* As you can see at the end of each implementation, we divide each activation by the dropout probability. The ensures that the expected value of the activation remains the same. This make training and testing faster.\n",
    "* Vector d[3] is used for forward and back propagation and is the same for them, but it is different for each iteration (pass) or training example.\n",
    "* At test time we don't use dropout. If you implement dropout at test time - it would add noise to predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dropout randomly knocks out units in your network. So it's as if on every iteration you're working with a smaller NN, and so using a smaller NN seems like it should have a regularizing effect.\n",
    "* With dropout regularization, you don't rely on any one feature, so have to spread out weights.\n",
    "* It's possible to show that dropout has a similar effect to L2 regularization.\n",
    "* Dropout can have different keep_prob per layer.\n",
    "* The input layer dropout has to be near 1 (or 1 - no dropout) because you don't want to eliminate a lot of features.\n",
    "* If you're more worried about some layers overfitting than others, you can set a lower keep_prob for some layers than others. The downside is, this gives you even more hyperparameters to search for using cross-validation. One other alternative might be to have some layers where you apply dropout and some layers where you don't apply dropout and then just have one hyperparameter, which is a keep_prob for the layers for which you do apply dropouts.\n",
    "* A lot of researchers are using dropout with Computer Vision (CV) because they have a very big input size and almost never have enough data, so overfitting is the usual problem. And dropout is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "* A downside of dropout is that the cost function J is not well defined and it will be hard to debug (plot J by iteration).\n",
    "    * To solve that you'll need to turn off dropout, set all the keep_probs to 1, and then run the code and check that it monotonically decreases J and then turn on the dropouts again."

    "* Graph that compares the performance of a model on training and testing data over a varying number of training instances\n",
    "* We should generally see performance improve as the number of training points increases\n",
    "* When we separate training and testing sets and graph them individually\n",
    "    * We can get an idea of how well the model can generalize to new data\n",
    "* Learning curve allows us to verify when a model has learned as much as it can about the data, when it occurs\n",
    "    * The performances on the training and testing sets reach a plateau\n",
    "    * There is a consistent gap between the two error rates\n",
    "* The key is to find the sweet spot that minimizes bias and variance by finding the right level of model complexity\n",
